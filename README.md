# 🔢 Arithmetic Suite 📚
*A Comprehensive Library of Python Scripts for Efficient Arithmetic and Mathematical Operations*

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- Effortlessly perform basic and advanced mathematical calculations.
- Ultra-lightweight (~300KB), with the compiled executable being just 7MB!
- Fully developed in **Python** 🐍.
- Constant updates planned for more features and tools.
- User-friendly and easy to implement in any project.

---

## ⚙️ **Requirements**
- **Python 3.12** or higher (not required if using the precompiled binary from the releases page).
- Any Python **IDE** (optional, unless you wish to modify the source code).

---

## 🛠️ **Modules**
This suite includes several core utilities, such as:

### ➕ Calculator Module
Perform basic arithmetic operations:
- **Division** ➗: `/`
- **Multiplication** ✖️: `*`
- **Addition** ➕: `+`
- **Subtraction** ➖: `-`

### 🔲 **Area Calculators**
- **Rectangle Area** 📏: `area_rectangle.py`
- **Triangle Area** 📐: `area_triangle.py`
- **Circle Area** 🔵: `area_circle.py`

### ➗ **Arithmetic Progression Tools**
- **AP Sum**: Calculate the sum of terms in an arithmetic progression.
- **AP nth Term**: Find the nth term of an arithmetic progression.

### 💰 **Simple Interest Calculator**
- **Simple Interest Calculation**: Compute simple interest based on principal, rate, and time.
  - **Module**: `simple_interest.py`

---

## 📋 **To-Do List**
- [✅] Compile to an executable (.exe) for easier use without Python installed.
- [✅] Add modules to calculate:
    - [✅] **Simple Interest**. 
    - [✅] **Compound Interest**.
- [ ] Add a **Re-Runner** Script(Enabling the user to re-run the program without quiting.)
- [ ] Expand suite with more advanced mathematical functions.

## 🖥️ **How to Run the Program**

There are **3 ways** to run the suite:

### 1. **From the Binary Release**
1. Download the precompiled `.exe` file from the [Releases Page](#).
2. Run the executable directly.
> ⚠️ *Note*: The program is in **beta**, so some bugs may occur. Please report any issues, and I will address them as soon as possible.

---

### 2. **From Source (Using an IDE)**
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/arithmetic-suite.git
    ```
2. Unzip the files to your preferred directory.
3. Open your favorite Python **IDE**.
4. Run the `Arithmetic Suite.py` file.
    - If you encounter any issues, try running `Main.py`.

---

### 3. **Using IDLE**
1. Clone the repository and unzip the files.
2. Right-click on `Arithmetic Suite.py` (or `Main.py` if there are errors).
3. Select `Edit with IDLE`.
4. Press **F5** or select **Run > Run Module** from the menu.
